\section{Beefy Distribution}
\label{sec:beefy}

For each finalized block $\block$ which a validator imports, said validator shall make a \textsc{bls} signature on the \textsc{bls}\oldstylenums{12}-\oldstylenums{381} curve, as defined by \cite{bls12-381}, affirming the Keccak hash of the block's most recent \textsc{Beefy} \textsc{mmr}. This should be published and distributed freely, along with the signed material. These signatures may be aggregated in order to provide concise proofs of finality to third-party systems. The signing and aggregation mechanism is defined fully by \cite{cryptoeprint:2022/1611}.

Formally, let $\accoutcommitment{v}$ be the signed commitment of validator index $v$ which will be published:
\begin{align}\label{eq:accoutsignedcommitment}
  \accoutcommitment{v} &\equiv \blssigndata{\activeset'\sub{v}}{\Xbeefy \concat \text{last}(\recenthistory)_\rhÂ¬accoutlogsuperpeak}\\
  \Xbeefy &= \token{\$jam\_beefy}
\end{align}
